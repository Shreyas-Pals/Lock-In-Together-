**Lock In - Together !**
------------------

**Note**: This project is in active development. Most of the features have not been implemented yet, but I'm going to work on implementing them!

This is a CLI - based multiuser interface allowing people to vote on whether a song should be played, manage queues, and more. This can be paired up with Spotify JAM - and actually help you to Lock In - whether you are coding/studying,etc., if you want to listen to the same music as your friends but also listen to something you like, this is perfect. Iâ€™m an audiophile, so building something around music is really exciting!

**Interfaces Available Right now:**
CLI - Interface: This is being built.
Web Based - I have sidelined this (this was supposed to be the main idea - but I'm not that much into web dev :)) so this will be done later.

There are many planned features yet to come!
